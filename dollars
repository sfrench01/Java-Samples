Write a program called Dollars that allows the user to enter an integer number of dollars and calculates and displays the conversion into currency denominationsâ€”20s, 10s, 5s, and 1s.
info> The conversion algorithm should return the smallest number of bills needed for the conversion. For example, $15 should break down into 1 $10 and 1 $5.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a number of dollars 3025
$3025 converted is 151 $20s, 0 $10s, 1 $5s, and 0 $1s

// Write your code here
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Dollars {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int twenty = 20;
        final int ten = 10;
        final int five = 5;
        final int one = 1;

        Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number if dollars ");

        int totalAmount = inputDevice.nextInt();
        int dividedTwenty = totalAmount / twenty;
        int remainderTwenty = totalAmount % twenty;
        
        int dividedTen = remainderTwenty / ten;
        int dividedFive = remainderTwenty / ten;
        int dividedOne = remainderTwenty % five;

    //    System.out.println(dividedTwenty + " " + remainderTwenty + " " + dividedTen + " " + dividedFive + " " + dividedOne);
        System.out.println("$" + totalAmount + " converted is " + dividedTwenty + " $20s, " + dividedTen + " $10s, " + dividedFive + " $5s, and " + dividedOne + " $1s");

    }
}
Output:
Enter a number if dollars 137
$137 converted is 6 $20s, 1 $10s, 1 $5s, and 2 $1s
