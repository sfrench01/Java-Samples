Assignment instructions:
Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen eggs or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. 
Write a program called Eggs that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation.

An example of the program is shown below:

You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85. 

// Write your code here
import java.util.Scanner;

import javax.xml.validation.Schema;
public class Eggs {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double singleCost = 0.45;
        final double dozenCost = 3.25;
        final int dozen = 12;
        Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter number of eggs ordered >> ");
        int eggsOrdered = inputDevice.nextInt();
        int countEggs = eggsOrdered / dozen;
        int remainderEggs = eggsOrdered % dozen;
        double dozenTotal = countEggs * dozenCost;
        double singleTotal = remainderEggs * singleCost;
        double totalCost = dozenTotal + singleTotal;
      
        //System.out.println("eggsOrdered " + eggsOrdered + " countEggs " + countEggs + " remainderEggs " + remainderEggs);
        //System.out.println("dozenTotal " + dozenTotal + " singleTotal " + singleTotal + " totalCost " + totalCost);
        System.out.println("You ordered " + eggsOrdered + " eggs. That's " + countEggs + " dozen at $" + dozenCost + " per dozen and " + remainderEggs + " loose eggs at " + singleCost + " cents each for a total of $" + totalCost);

    }
}

Output:
Enter number of eggs ordered >> 27
You ordered 27 eggs. That's 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 0.45 cents each for a total of $7.85
