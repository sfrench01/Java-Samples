Part A
Implement the MileConversions class so that it declares the following named constants: INCHES_IN_MILE, FEET_IN_MILE, and YARDS_IN_MILE. Each constant to represent the number of inches, feet, and yards in a mile.

Next declare a variable named miles to represent a number of miles and assign a value to it.

Compute and display, with explanatory text, the value in inches, feet, and yards.

// Write your code here
public class MileConversions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double INCHES_IN_MILE = 63360;
        final double FEET_IN_MILE = 5280;
        final double YARDS_IN_MILE = 1760;

        double miles = 10;
        double inchesToMiles = miles * INCHES_IN_MILE;
        double feetToMiles = miles * FEET_IN_MILE;
        double yardsToMiles = miles * YARDS_IN_MILE;
        System.out.println(miles + " miles = " + inchesToMiles + " inches, or " + feetToMiles + " feet, or " + yardsToMiles + " yards");
    }   
}
Output:
10.0 miles = 633600.0 inches, or 52800.0 feet, or 17600.0 yards

Part B
Convert the MileConversions program to an interactive application by copying the code into the MileConversionsInteractive.java file. Instead of assigning a value to the miles variable, accept it from the user as input.
An example of the program is shown below:

Enter miles >> 4.5
4.5 miles is 285120.0 inches, or 23760.0 feet, or 7920.0 yards

// Write your code here
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MileConversionsInteractive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double INCHES_IN_MILE = 63360;
        final double FEET_IN_MILE = 5280;
        final double YARDS_IN_MILE = 1760;

        Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter miles >> ");

        double miles = inputDevice.nextDouble();
        double inchesToMiles = miles * INCHES_IN_MILE;
        double feetToMiles = miles * FEET_IN_MILE;
        double yardsToMiles = miles * YARDS_IN_MILE;
        System.out.println(miles + " miles = " + inchesToMiles + " inches, or " + feetToMiles + " feet, or " + yardsToMiles + " yards");
    }    
}

Output:
Enter miles >> 10
10.0 miles = 633600.0 inches, or 52800.0 feet, or 17600.0 yards
