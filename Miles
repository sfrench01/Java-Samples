Part A
Implement the MileConversions class so that it declares the following named constants: INCHES_IN_MILE, FEET_IN_MILE, and YARDS_IN_MILE. Each constant to represent the number of inches, feet, and yards in a mile.

Next declare a variable named miles to represent a number of miles and assign a value to it.

Compute and display, with explanatory text, the value in inches, feet, and yards.

Part B
Convert the MileConversions program to an interactive application by copying the code into the MileConversionsInteractive.java file. Instead of assigning a value to the miles variable, accept it from the user as input.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter miles >> 4.5
4.5 miles is 285120.0 inches, or 23760.0 feet, or 7920.0 yards
