Part A
Write a program called InchesToFeet that declares a variable named inches, which holds a length in inches, and assign 86 as the value.
Display the value in feet and inches. Be sure to use a named constant where appropriate.
An example of the program is shown below:
86 inches is 7 feet and 2 inches

// Write your code here
public class InchesToFeet {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int inches = 86;
        final int feet = 12;
        int feetDivided = inches / feet;
        int remainderInches = inches % feetDivided;

        System.out.println(inches + " inches is " + feetDivided + " feet and " + remainderInches + " inches");
    }
}
Output:
86 inches is 7 feet and 2 inches

Part B
Convert the InchesToFeet class into an interactive program by copying the code into the InchesToFeetInteractive file and modifying it to accept the inches value from a user.
An example of the program is shown below:

Enter inches >> 89
89 inches is 7 feet and 5 inches

// Write your code here
import java.util.Scanner;
public class InchesToFeetInteractive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int feet = 12;
        
        Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter inches >> ");
        int inches = inputDevice.nextInt();

        int feetDivided = inches / feet;
        int remainderInches = inches % feetDivided;

        System.out.println(inches + " inches is " + feetDivided + " feet and " + remainderInches + " inches");
    }
}
Output:
Enter inches >> 86    
86 inches is 7 feet and 2 inches
